3. Format the output for each diagram as a separate paragraph, ensuring that all label numbers are explicitly mentioned in brackets and described.

Please ensure that:
- All label numbers are explicitly mentioned in brackets (e.g., (10), (12), (14)).
- Each label is described clearly in the context of the figure.
- The description of the entire figure is clear and concise.
